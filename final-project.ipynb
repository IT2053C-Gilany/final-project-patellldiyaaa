    "\n",
    "> - Fields\n",
    "This dataset includes 7 different sheets. \n",
    "- Sheet: OrderList KeyFields: Order ID, Order Date, Origin Port, Carrier, TPT, Service Level, Ship ahead day count, Ship late day count, Customer,\n",
    "Product ID, Plant Code, Destination Port, Unit Quantity, Weight\n",
    "- Sheet: FreightRates KeyFields: Carrier, origin_port_cd, dest_port_cd, minm_wgh_qty, svs_cd, minimum cost, rate, mode_dsc, tpt_day_cnt, carrier type\n",
    "- Sheet: WhCosts KeyFields: WH, Cost/Unit\n",

    "### Data set selection rationale\n",
    "\n",
    "> Why did you select this data set?\n",
    "- I choose this dataset because it provides realistic stimulated supply chain data that is easy to work with anaylsis and visualization. It will allow\n",
    "me to explore how different parts of a supply chain affect delivery cost and delivery time. Evevn though the data is not real, it still reflects real business like situations and can help show data analysis can improve effciency and decision-making. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Questions to be answered\n",
    "\n",
    "> Using statistical analysis and visualization, what questions would you like to be able answer about this dataset.\n",
    "> This could include questions such as:\n",
    ">\n",
    "> - What is the relationship between X and Y variables?\n",
    "> - What is the distribution of the variables?\n",
    "> - What is the relationship between the variables and the target?\n",
    ">   You will need to frame these questions in a way to show value to a stakeholder (i.e.why should we know about the relationship between X and Y variables?)\n",
    "\n",
    "Questions: \n",
    "- Which Suppliers have the highest average lead times and shipping costs?\n",
    "**Helps identify potential improvement areas for supplier performance\n",
    "\n",
    "- Is there a measureable relationship between order quantity and total shipping cost?\n",
    "**Determines whether larger orders produce cost savings\n",
    "\n",
    "- How do delivery times vary across different regions or transport modes?\n",
    "**Reveals problem areas in certain regions or shipping routes that cause delays and raise costs\n",
    "\n",
    "- What trends exist in total delivery volumes sand average shipping costs over time?\n",
    "**Shows how demand and work levels rise or fall during different times of the year\n",
    "\n",
    "- Do busier warehouses have higher operating costs?\n",
    "**Examines how changes in warehouse uses affect costs and overall efficeincy \n",
    "\n",
    "### Visualization ideas\n",
    "\n",
    "> Provide a few examples of what you plan to visualize to answer the questions you posed in the previous section. In this project, you will be producing 6-8 visualizations. You will also be producing an interactive chart using Plotly.\n",
    "\n",
    "-  bar chart: showing supplier vs. average lead time which would compare supplier effiency and highlight outliers\n",
    "- heatmap: region vs. average shipping cost which would examine correlation and scaling effects\n",
    "- line chart: month vs. (total deliveries, average cost) which would demonstrate seasonal trends\n",
    "- boxplot: warehouse utilization vs. variable cost which would show cost variability across capacity levels\n",
    "- historgram: lead times vs. number of orders showing delivery times spread across all orders\n",
    "- interactive plotly dashboard: supplier and region filters, can explore delivery times and shipping costs by supplier or region\n",
    "\n",
    "> Think about what those visualization could be: what are the variables used in the charts? what insights do you hope to gain from them?\n",
    "- Each visualization will focus on showing how costs, delivery times, and performance differ across suppliers, regions, and time. The charts will use variables such as supplier name, region, shipping cost, lead time, and order quantity. From these visuals, I hope to identify which suppliers or regions are less efficient, find patterns in delivery times, and see how costs change with order size or season. \n"
